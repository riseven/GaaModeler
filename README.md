# GaaModeler

*A simple 3D modeller and renderer for the Advanced Graphics class.*

For the class of Advanced Graphics and Animation (GAA) I developed a basic
gemoetry modeller, and a handful of rendering and lightning algorithms. The 
culprit was implmenenting the Radiosity lightning algorithm with patch 
subdivision.
